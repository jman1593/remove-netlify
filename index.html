<p>Hi there! If you are seeing this page, that means your are trying to connect to a netlify version of strongdog! We are moving off of netlify because it is starting to rack up a TON of costs, and so we are moving back to github but with newer links!<br>Here are the new links from the old netlify ones:<br><br>strongdogxp.github.io<br>mathcordxp.github.io<br>If you used to use stroongdog.netlify.app, the updated github link is on the discord in the same place you found the original link<br><br>DON'T FORGET TO SET NEW BOOKMARKS!!! THIS PAGE IS GOING DOWN SOON!!!</p>
